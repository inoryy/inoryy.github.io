# Biography

I have started my career path as a self-taught web developer, specializing with Symfony web framework. 
I have worked on projects of various scale in many different domains such as finance, education and health. During this time I have actively participated in the open-source community, contributing to projects I used, and releasing my own projects for others to use.

Eventually I have decided to pivot my career and take an active part in research and development of a field I am very passionate about: artificial intelligence. To fulfill this goal I have had to catch up on missed education, starting from bachelor's degree.

I have opted to pursue an undergraduate degree in Mathematical Statistics, complementing my programming skills with strong mathematical foundation.  
In the summer of 2018 I have successfully defended my [bachelor's thesis](/files/ring_roman_bsc.pdf), replicating DeepMind's architecture and results in the StarCraft II environment.

With solid theoretical background I am now filling in the blanks in my computer science knowledge, while working on a research-focused masters thesis.
