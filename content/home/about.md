# Biography

I have started my career path as a self-taught web developer, specializing with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) web framework. 
I have worked on projects of various scale, including online education platforms, 360Â° virtual tour guides, and fitness planners.  
During this time I have made numerous contributions the open-source community, both directly to the projects I've relied upon, and releasing my own projects.

Eventually I have decided to pivot my career and take an active part in research and development of a field I am passionate about: artificial intelligence. To fulfill this goal I have had to catch up on missed education, starting from bachelor's degree.

I have decided to pursue an undergraduate degree in Mathematical Statistics, complementing practical skills with strong theoretical foundation.
This summer I have defended the bachelor's thesis and am confident I have made the right choice.

With solid mathematical background I can now fill in the blanks in programming skills while working on a research-focused MSc thesis.
