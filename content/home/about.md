# Biography

I began my career as a self-taught web developer, specializing in  [Symfony PHP framework](http://symfony.com/), while working on projects of various scale in many different domains such as finance, education, and health.
During this time, [I actively participated](https://github.com/inoryy?tab=overview&from=2012-12-01&to=2012-12-31) in the open-source community, contributing to the projects I used, and releasing my own.

After five years of work experience, I decided to pivot my career and take an active part in the research and development of a field I am very passionate about -- artificial intelligence.
To fulfill this goal, I had to catch up on missed education, starting with a bachelor’s degree.
I chose to pursue an undergraduate degree in mathematical statistics to complement my programming skills with a strong mathematical foundation.

In the summer of 2018, I successfully defended my [bachelor’s thesis](/files/ring_roman_bsc.pdf),
replicating DeepMind’s preliminary results and architecture with deep reinforcement learning methods in the [StarCraft II learning environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04782).
I continued my education with a master’s in computer science, filling in the blanks in the theory I missed beforehand.

In the summer of 2019, I interned as a research engineer at DeepMind in London, UK; contributing to the [AlphaStar](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning) project, and experimenting with the [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) library.

In march of 2020 I joined DeepMind as a research engineer.
